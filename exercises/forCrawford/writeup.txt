1. A database is a file that contains one or more tables.
These tables store data in rows with various attributes or values across the columns.
You can use databases for persistance of data.

2. Files can be time consuming to read and then you have to sort through the data. They are also difficult to manage and relate.
With databases you can query for the specific information you require.

3. A schema is essentially a skeleton for your table. Or template, whichever you prefer.
it defines what columns your table should contain and what type the values with be.

4. My guess is no. For instance, when you are accessing your database through a ruby script, the
line db.execute creates an instance in which you run sqlite3 to access your database. Once this line of code is executed, you exit
that instance. This is only my humble assumption!
